## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?
See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording. 
 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

 * Displays code and notes **neatly** in one report
 * Allows for easy replication by other users
 * Allows plots/tables to be *automatically* updated when code is altered
 * Easier collaboration between R Markdown and Git
 * Easily presents results with the code used to generate them


## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

|      **Dataset Name**      |                    **Relevant Information**                      |
|:---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|EPA Air O3                  | Air quality data from the EPA for various sites (ozone)          |
|EPA Air PM 2.5              | Air quality data from the EPA for various sites (particulates)   |
|NTL-LTER Lake Nutrients     | Lake data at various depths (irradiance, temp, DO)               |
|NTL-LTER Lake Chemistry     | Lake chemistry data (TN, TP, NH3, NO3, PO4, etc.)                |
|NEON NIWO Litter Mass Data  | Litter data for various plots (dry mass, litter functional group)|


## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r Install.Packages, eval=FALSE}
# installing package knitr
install.packages('knitr')

```

### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.

Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# checking working directory
getwd()

# loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)

# setting ggplot theme
Andrew.Theme <- theme_gray() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(Andrew.Theme)

# loading the dataset
Lake.Nutrients.Raw <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# displaying head of dataset
head(Lake.Nutrients.Raw)

# setting date to date format
Lake.Nutrients.Raw$sampledate <- as.Date(Lake.Nutrients.Raw$sampledate, format = "%m / %d / %y")

```


### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r}
# wrangling dataset
Lake.Nutrients.Processed <- Lake.Nutrients.Raw %>% 
                                select(lakename:sampledate, depth:po4) %>% 
                                filter(depth == 0) %>% 
                                drop_na()

```

Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r include=FALSE}
# TN summary dataset for each lake
TN.Summary <- Lake.Nutrients.Processed %>% 
                group_by(lakename) %>% 
                summarise(Mean = mean(tn_ug),
                          Minumum = min(tn_ug),
                          Maximum = max(tn_ug),
                          Standard_Deviation = sd(tn_ug))

# TP summary dataset for each lake
TP.Summary <- Lake.Nutrients.Processed %>% 
                group_by(lakename) %>% 
                summarise(Mean = mean(tp_ug),
                          Minumum = min(tp_ug),
                          Maximum = max(tp_ug),
                          Standard_Deviation = sd(tp_ug))

```

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(TN.Summary, caption = "Total N Summary Statistics by Lake", col.names = c("Lake Name", "Mean", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Standard Deviation"), align = 'c')

kable(TP.Summary, caption = "Total P Summary Statistics by Lake", col.names = c("Lake Name", "Mean", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Standard Deviation"), align = 'c')

```

Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap='Total Nitrogen for Each Lake'}

# plotting total N over time
ggplot(Lake.Nutrients.Processed) +
  geom_line(aes(x=sampledate, y=tn_ug, color=lakename)) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Total Nitrogen (ug)", color = "Lake Name") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap='Total Phosphorus for Each Lake'}

# plotting total P over time
ggplot(Lake.Nutrients.Processed)+
  geom_line(aes(x=sampledate, y=tp_ug, color=lakename)) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Total Phosphorus (ug)", color = "Lake Name") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

>   For both nitrogen and phosphorus there were dramatic increases at the end of 1996 and into 1997 with some recovery between 1997 and 2000. West Long Lake and East Long Lake have the highest levels of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to the other lakes in this dataset. The standard deviation for total nitrogen is much higher than for phosphorus due to higher variability in the data. Hummingbird Lake has the highest average TN and TP but this is likely due to it only having a few data points that are very recent. 

---

>   Next steps could involve determining if/which lakes differ from the mean TN and TP levels of all lakes. This would require the use of ANOVA tests to determine differences in means. Other tests could involve understanding how depth plays a role in total nitrogen and phosphorus using a model. Finally, a third analysis could be a trend analysis on total nitrogen and phosphorus values over time and investigating how seasonality has played a role on this trend.

## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true
